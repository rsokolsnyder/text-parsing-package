## Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up text-parsing-package for
local development.

1. Fork the https://github.com/UBC-MDS/text_parsing_package
   repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally (*if you want to work locally*)

    ```shell
    git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/text_parsing_package.git
    ```

3. Create a conda environment to work in and make sure that [hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/install/) is installed alongside Python.

4. Create a branch for local development using the default branch (typically `main`) as a starting point. Use `doc` as a prefix for your branch name.

    ```shell
    git checkout main
    git checkout -b doc-name-of-your-documentation
    ```

    Now you can make your changes locally.

5. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub. Please make commit messages clear.

    ```shell
    git add .
    git commit -m "fix: summarize your changes"
    git push -u origin doc-name-of-your-documentation
    ```

6. Open the link displayed in the message when pushing your new branch in order
