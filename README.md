## Summary



## Package Functions



## Relation to Existing Package Ecosystem

There exists other packages in the Python ecosystem which are capable of performing in essence the same tasks as this package,
however there are stylistic implementation differences, for which the end-user may prefer. Overall, the landscape for text 
processing is quite saturated in the python ecosystem. This is due to text parsing being such a common task and the Python
ecosystem being so vast. For example the visualization packages for text data that exist already are not as specific as the
implementation contained in this package, they are more generic but may require more lines of code to reproduce the output 
of this package. Similarly, the text cleaning/preprocessing functionality of this package likely does not exist already in
the ecosystem in the exact same implementation and may have stylistic differences, but similar operations can be done with
other packages to obtain the same modified text string. The unique word count functionality of this package is likely 
implemented differently "under the hood" than other solutions present in the ecosystem in the same way, but will produce the
same final output as existing packages. Examples of existing packages are shown below (not an exhaustive list):

Text visualization package examples:

[WordCloud](https://pypi.org/project/wordcloud/)
[Scattertext](https://pypi.org/project/scattertext/)

Text cleaning/preprocessing package examples:
