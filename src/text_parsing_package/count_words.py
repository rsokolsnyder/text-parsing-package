    """
    Count the instances of unique words in a text string.

    Input text is assumed to be separated by single spaces and punctuation

    spaces and/or the text contains punctuation.

        string of text to count instances of case sensitive unique words
    
    ignore_words: list[str]
        list of strings of words to exclude from the counting.
        
    Returns
    -------
    word_count_dict: dict
        A dictionary of words as str keys and their counts as int values

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If input type is incorrect.

    Examples
    --------
    word_count_dict = count_unique_words('I go where I go')
    >>> {'I': 2, 'go': 2, }

    word_count_dict = count_unique_words('The the the thing', ignore_words = ['the'])
    >>> {'thing': 1}
